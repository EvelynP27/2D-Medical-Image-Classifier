# 2D-Medical-Image-Classifier

## Overview
This repository contains a machine-learning project focused on building a 2D convolutional neural network to classify medical images.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of 58954 samples of 2D medical images. The dataset was obtained from [MedNIST: 2D Medical Images Dataset](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI-extra-test-data/releases/download/0.8.1/MedNIST.tar.gz)

## Approach
- Importing data: Reading and normalizing images
- Model training: Training the selected algorithm on the preprocessed dataset.
- Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model based on precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy
